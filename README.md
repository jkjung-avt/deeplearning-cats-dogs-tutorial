## A Practical Introduction to Deep Learning with Caffe and Python

I forked this very nice Caffe/Python tutorial code from [adilmoujahid's repository](https://github.com/adilmoujahid/deeplearning-cats-dogs-tutorial). And I modified the code so that it could run on Jetson TX2 with python3. For more details, please refer to my blog: [https://jkjung-avt.github.io/](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/).

The original blog post by adilmoujahid which comes with this code could be found here: [A Practical Introduction to Deep Learning with Caffe and Python](http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2016/06/introduction-deep-learning-python-caffe/).
