## A Practical Introduction to Deep Learning with Caffe and Python

I forked this very nice Caffe/Python tutorial code from [adilmoujahid's repository](https://github.com/adilmoujahid/deeplearning-cats-dogs-tutorial). I then modified the code so that it could run on **NVIDIA Jetson TX2** with **python3**. For more details, please refer to my blog: [https://jkjung-avt.github.io/caffe-tutorial-on-tx2/](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/caffe-tutorial-on-tx2/).
